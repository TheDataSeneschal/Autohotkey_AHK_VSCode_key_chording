- **Escape + n + m**: Open or focus PotPlayer, or display a message if no video is playing.
- **Escape + y + n**: Open or focus Google Chrome.
- **Escape + y + m**: Open Notepad.
- **Escape + m + n**: Open or focus Brave Browser.
- **Escape + n + n**: Left-click at the current mouse position.
- **Escape + y + y**: Copy the selected text to the clipboard and display a confirmation message.
